#Arrival time:- It is the time to reach from the starting point to end point is called arrival time. 
Arrival time usually calculated at the end point.
As from the first image there are four end point are as D of first flip flop, D of second flip flop and there are two end point for output (OUT)port i.e. first from the D from second flip flop and one from the input port (IN).
Requird time:- It define what's the system specifications or need of system.
Example:- the frequency of the design is one gigahertz, so we have to make such a arrangements such that the arrival time fulfill the requirements of one gigahertz or one nanosecond.
Slack:- the diffence between the arrival time and required time. 
Example:- Tje data should be at the first flip flop should be between .5 ns to 3ns means the data can take the minimum time .5 ns and max time 3 ns.
Let's say that the arrival time is 3.5 ns then the diffence between the min time from arrival time is called as min slack time i.e 3ns and in the same way the difference between the arrival time from max time is max slack time.
The max slack time is known as slack
